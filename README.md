# ArtG

ARTG, which builds a product for the art galleries. The main aim of this is , a database with a
schema that takes all the data that galleries must maintain. The galleries maintain the information
about artists, their unique names, place of birth, age, and the style of art. For each piece of art, the
artist, the year it was made, its unique title, its type of art (e.g., painting, lithograph, sculpture,
photograph), and its price/cost must be stored. The pieces of art can also classified into groups like
portraits, still lifes, works by Picasso and so on. An art may belong to more than one group. Each
group is identified by a unique name which describes the group. The galleries also keep information
about customers. For each customer, galleries keep that person’s unique name, address, total amount
of money spent in the gallery and the artists and groups of art that the customer tends to like. Above
all you can also become an art dealer. Moreover, you have to have a vision and everything you
exhibit and offer for sale should explain that vision. Showing the consistency in the artwork is
unique. The very old definition of art gallery is gone, most of the art galleries are unique and
attractive. The best location for an art gallery is the best upscale business people who share their
ideas. When it comes to buying an art, very few people do this. The people who are well educated
and have great artistic thought, plain hearted and various other mentalities of people will go further
to buy an art. There may be a variety of art galleries but don’t try to become there will be everything
for everybody. Most of the times, the art maker has to open the gallery highlighting their own
paintings and art. The American art and Spanish art play a vital role in the world of art galleries. The
people will have to look forward to buy an art in the perspective of nature lover or maintain your
own gallery in the perspective of manager.
